I started casually pen spinning at the end of highschool.

# Spinning

## My history

Near the end of highschool I bought a weighted pen intended for pen spinning. I looked up some basic spinning tutorials online and learned to spin it around my thumb and between my index and middle finger. From there on I just played around with it a bit more, and came up with various other (basic) spins by myself. There aren't too many variations I can do, but enough for it to look somewhat interesting.

I don't pracctice actively with pen spinning anymore, but I've noticed almost anything that's thin and long can be spun. So I quite frequently try to spin random objects such as remotes, sticks, my phone, food, etc.

## Some fun videos

Below are some videos of me spinning things. They are vertically recorded because they were intended to be posted on instagram instead of youtube.
