I bought freeskates after I saw people doing cool tricks on instagram.

# Freeskating

Freeskates are the crossbread of a skateboard and rollerblades. You stand on it similar to a skateboard while rolling sideways, but they are 2 completely independent platforms. You propel yourself by applying a perpendicilar force while slanting the wheels, similar to how you propel yourself with rolleblades. But in contrast to both rollerblades and skateboards, you never lift your feet. You simply continue zigzagging with your feet.

## My history

Instagram's feed kept showing me really cool videos from [JMKRide](https://www.jmkride.com/) of people performing cool tricks on freeskates. Even just the motion of moving around on these already looked very satisfying and instantly spoke to me.

One day when seeing yet another one of their videos, I decided to do a quick search to see how expensive such "freeskates" would be. It turned out that you can buy a set for 40 euros on amazon, which was considerably cheaper than expected. I very impulsively ordered a pair, and after around 3 weeks they finally arrived, exactly at the start of the summer break of 2022.

I first practiced the motion in my kitchen/hall. After around 2-3 hours I started getting the hang of the motion and could propel myself. I then decided to go to my university's library, because there is a very smooth concrete floor in fron of this library which is popular among skaters. After about an hour I started being able to somewhat keep my balance and ride some distance.

I practiced for a couple of weeks and started to slowely become more and more agile on the skates. I also started feeling the limitation of these cheap skates by then, and decided I liked the skates well enough to put down the 150 euros for branded JMKRide skates, which I customized to have a black and blue color theme.

These new skates ride much smoother and turned out to be well worth the money. I sometimes use the skates for transport by riding on bicycle lanes in my city, and I'm starting to learn some of the tricks you can do with the skates. It will however still take a very long time before I will be consistent at these tricks, and there are penty of more tricks to be learned.

## Some fun videos

Below are some videos of me riding on my skates and practicing things. They are verically recorded because they were intedned to be posted on instagram stories instead of on youtube.
