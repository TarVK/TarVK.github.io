My friends from the board association convinced me to get into longboarding.

# Longboarding

Longboard dancing is an offspring discipline from skateboarding. A longer heavier board is used than with skateboarding, and there's more focus on flowy movements instead of jumps and flips. However, in the longboard freestyle discipline, people do perform crazy jumps and flips with these boards too. These are usually on flatground instead of multi-leveled terrain like in skateboarding. The dancing and freestyle disciplines are often combined. Most people have a longboard style that contains a bit of both, but may lean more towards freestyle or more towards dancing.

## My history

I joined board association [Avalanche boarders](https://avalancheboarders.nl/) when I started [freeskating](/hobbies/freeskating). No other members of Avalanche freeskate, instead the street part of Avalanche consisted of skateboards and longboarders. Eventually at the end of April 2023, people managed to convince me to start longboarding too, after we visited the [longboard world championships in Eindhoven](https://sycld.nl/) earlier that month.

I bought my board second handed from another member of the association, and immediately started drilling tricks. Some of my freeskate skills transferred to this new medium, allowing me to do some simple pirouettes and other spin tricks right away. It has however taken a while to really get some stability on the board, but by now I am starting to get a bit of flow in my movements. I bought my current board in april 2024 at longboard world championship, roughly a year after I initially started.

## Some fun videos

Below are some videos of me riding on my longboard and practicing things. Because the videos were intended for instagram, they have been recorded vertically. Check the end of the list for the most recent clips!
