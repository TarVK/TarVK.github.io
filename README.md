Simple portfolio website

The code is rather messy, since I just tried to quickly get something working with the features I want such that I can start writing some articles. A large portion of the code was taken from [LaunchMenu's website](https://github.com/LaunchMenu/LaunchMenu.github.io) and modified to work nicely as a personal website.

Pages are written using mdx, and include some metadata that can be used for searching and to add open graph data for previews when sharing links. These pages can be found in `public/pages`.
