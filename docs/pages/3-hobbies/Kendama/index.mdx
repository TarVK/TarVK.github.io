I bought a Kendama after I saw people playing with them in freerunning vlogs.

# Kendama

## My history

I learned about this toy through freerunning vlogs. It seems like they are relatively popular in the freerun community, since I've seen them in multiple vlogs of different people.

I bought my first Kendama in the beginning of 2021, and slowely started getting more into it. I've gone through several Kendamas by now, since they are made of wood and wear out quite quickly in my hands. I leave the Kendama on a shelve in the kitchen and end up practicing a bit every day whenever I pass through the kitchen, including when cooking dinner.

I take some inspiration from professionals I see on Instagram, but I'm not near any level like that. These people manage to juggle in different ways for a long time, hit the Ken (the handle) in the air in between, and finish it by landing a spike. This video below is the closest I've gotten to such a level, but I'm nowhere consistent at that combo yet:

## Some fun videos

Below are some videos of me playing with my Kendama. They are vertically recorded because they were intended to be posted on instagram instead of youtube. Note that most tricks you see me do without putting it in a combo, is a trick I'm not consistent at. Often times I just perform many many attempts while recording, until I finally get a success on camera.
