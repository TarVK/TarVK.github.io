I'm a decent juggler, and waste a reasonable amount of time on it.

# Juggling

## My history

In highschool we learned the basic juggling pattern in PE.
I don't know the exact date, but it was probably when I was about 15 years old.

I only ended up getting really into it around 2018 though (when I was about 19 years old). By just messing around a bit, I learned I could come up with some more advanced throws (like throwing underneath one of my arms). From then on I've been practicing quite regularly, practicing it during study breaks, programming breaks, or when I'm just bored.

By now there are several patterns I can do, but most of them I cannot do very cleanly. Most of these patterns I figured out myself, but are reasonably simple and therefore definitely not new. My favorite style of juggling is to just make a mess of these patterns rather than clearly repeating a pattern, which results in a chaos that I find quite pleasing to look at myself.

By now I also follow several instagram accounts of people that are insanely good at juggling. From time to time I try to learn some of the simpler patterns that I see these people perform.

I also own some nice rechargeable LED juggling balls now, which look pretty neat.

## Some fun videos

Below are some videos of me juggling. Apologies for them mostly being recorded vertically, but all of them were recorded for instagram stories. Some of these are also videos I recorded while practicing new patterns.
