I've been 3d modelling and 3d printing for a while. Most of the things I made were just to fix small issues around the house.

# 3D modelling/printing

## 3D modelling

I've started out 3D modeling using [Autodesk 123d design](https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/123d-apps) after watching videos by [James Bruton](https://youtu.be/mu_xY2UhrdY?t=356) for several years. His videos were what got me interested in both 3D modelling and printing.

Later 123D-design got discontinued, and I moved to using [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).

With my latest models in Fusion 360 I have been trying to model everything as parametrically as possible. This is very useful for when you need to make changes down the line, since you can just change parameters and don't have to redo your entire work. The investment and pay-off is similar to investing in code quality. It initially takes more time and effort, but you will find that it's usually beneficial in the long run.

## 3D printing

With my first job (in a green house) I saved up for my first 3d-printer. I bought an UP mini, predecessor of the [UP mini 2](https://www.tiertime.com/up-mini-2/). I chose this printer because it was one of the best printers that was marketed as a "plug and play" printer. This was a bit of a mistake in hindsight, mostly because I paid 700 euros for it but also because it only had a tiny print bed. It eventually stopped working (for unknown reasons) and printers like these aren't easy to debug and fix due to their closed-source nature.

For this original printer my father and I also made a wooden air-tight encasing. This case had 10cm diameter ventilation tubes coming out of it which I could put out my window. This was an attempt at reducing how many toxic fumes I would inhale, since the printer stood in my room as I had to transfer files over a wired USB-connection from my PC.

When the UP mini stopped working I decided to go the opposite route and buy a 'hackable' 3D printer. I still didn't feel like having to invest time into debugging the printer, but it's a nice idea that if I ever do need to fix something, I can. So I went with an Ender 5, predecessor of the [Ender 5 Pro](https://www.creality3dofficial.eu/products/ender-5-pro-3d-printer). This printer only set me back around 250 euros, and has a much larger print-bed. It additionally does not require a wired connection to a PC but instead allows you to transfer files using a micro-SD card. This allowed me to put the printer in our kitchen where I can open the doors and properly ventilate when it's printing. This printer is still working very well up to this date!

## Prints

The most complex thing I designed was my hidden blade, which you can find at [/projects/hidden-blade](/projects/hidden-blade).

But I also designed several small things that I had a practical use for. One of the earliest things I designed was a stand for my oculus rift:

<ImageGrid images={["~/oculusStand.jpg", "~/oculusStandPrint.jpg"]} />

Apart from that I designed several small things. Such as some feet for my projector that allows me to place it at the head end of my bed and point it at the ceiling at a good angle:

A fixture to hang an ethernet switch on the wall (on an outlet), as well as a cover for it:

A camera mount to mount the [Insta350 GO 2](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-go2/) to bicycling helmet, to record a mountain biking trip:

Some feet to fix a wobbly table:
